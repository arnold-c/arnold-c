Hi! I'm Callum, a 3rd year PhD candidate in the Biology department at Penn State, studying infectious disease epidemiology.
I spend a lot of my day thinking about respiratory viruses (currently SARS-CoV-2 and measles), using traditional epidemiological methods and mathematical transmission models to better understand the burden of disease.
More specifically, I am exploring how the choices we make when discretizing continuous and complex phenomena, such as assigning individuals into different transmission risk groups or turning an serological IgG optical density value into a binary positive/negative result, affects our ability to prevent, detect, and even understand outbreaks.

I mainly work in R and Julia, but sometimes dabble with Python for personal projects, and am currently learning Javascript (and D3), as well as Stan for bayesian data analysis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - The [Data4Action cohort study](https://github.com/arnold-c/Data4Action-Public) to better understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in University communities
  - Measles burden estimation, and a vaccination campaign effectiveness evaluation, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in collaboration with the Epicentre team from MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res
  - Developing methods for better detection measles outbreak in settings with limited resources and test capabilities
  - Creating a handbook about [Julia for epidemiologists](https://juliaepibook.callumarnold.com/), inspired by the excellent [EpiRHandbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Javascript
  - Stan
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on any interesting epidemiology projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - At my twitter (although I'm not particularly active, I will respond to DMs)
  - Via email (__arnold__ *dot* __crk__ *at* __gmail__ *dot* __com__)
