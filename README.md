Hi! I'm Callum, a 2nd year PhD candidate in the Biology department at Penn State, 
studying infectious disease epidemiology. I spend a lot of my day thinking 
about ways to model respiratory viruses (currently SARS-CoV-2 and measles), 
often using both traditional epidemiological methods and mathematical models 
(compartmental and occasionally network), to better understand burdens of 
disease, incidence forecasting, and optimization of operational decisions 
resulting from scenario projections. I mainly work in R, but sometimes dabble 
with Python and am currently learning Stan for bayesian data analysis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - The [Data4Action cohort study](https://github.com/arnold-c/Data4Action-Public) to better understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in University communities
  - A couple of projects examining the burden of measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Stan
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting epidemiology projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - At my twitter (although I'm not particularly active, I will respond to DMs)
  - Via email (__callum__ *dot* __arnold__ *at* __outlook__ *dot* __com__)
